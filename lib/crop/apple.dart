However, some farmers have started cultivating apple in some parts of the state using advanced techniques such as controlled atmosphere storage and high-density planting.The best time to plant apple trees in Kerala is during the winter season, between November and February, when the climate is relatively cool and dry. The trees require a cold climate to bear fruit, so they need to be planted at high altitudes, where the temperature is lower.The apple trees in Kerala usually start bearing fruit in 2-3 years after planting, and the fruit is usually harvested between June and August. However, the yield of apple in Kerala is still relatively low compared to other apple-growing regions due to the challenging climate conditions. ",
