However, some farmers in the state have started cultivating muskmelon in recent years using advanced techniques such as polyhouse cultivation and drip irrigation.The best time to cultivate muskmelon in Kerala is during the winter season, between October and February, when the climate is relatively cool and dry. The crop requires a warm and dry climate for its growth, and the winter season in Kerala provides the ideal conditions for its cultivation.The yield of muskmelon in Kerala varies depending on the variety, soil type, climate, and other factors. On average, the yield of muskmelon in Kerala is around 10-12 tons per hectare.Muskmelon grown in Kerala is mainly used for domestic consumption and is sold in local markets. The state government has also taken several initiatives to promote muskmelon cultivation in the state and provide support to the farmers, including providing subsidies for planting materials and equipment, and setting up cold storage facilities to help farmers with storage and marketing of the crop.",
