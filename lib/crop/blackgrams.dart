The crop is usually sown in October and harvested in February.Farmers in Kerala usually grow blackgram in paddy fields after the monsoon season, as the residual moisture in the soil after the paddy crop is suitable for the growth of blackgram. The crop is grown as a rainfed crop in most parts of the state, and irrigation is provided only in cases of prolonged dry spells.Blackgram is an important crop for small and marginal farmers in Kerala, and it is used for various purposes such as making dals, soups, and curries. It is also used in the production of papads, vadas, and other traditional snacks. ",
