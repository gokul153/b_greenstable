However, some farmers have started experimenting with growing lentils in the high altitude areas of Wayanad district, where the climate is relatively cooler.The cultivation of lentil in Kerala is mainly done during the winter season, between November and February, when the climate is cooler and drier. The crop requires well-drained soil and a temperate climate for its growth, and the winter season in Kerala provides the ideal conditions for its cultivation.The yield of lentil in Kerala is relatively low compared to other pulse crops, such as blackgram and green gram. On average, the yield of lentil in Kerala is around 400-500 kg per hectare. However, the state government has taken several initiatives to promote the cultivation of lentil in the state and provide support to the farmers, including providing subsidies for planting materials and equipment, and setting up lentil processing units to help farmers with value addition.",
