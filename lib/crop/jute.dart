Jute is mainly grown in the delta regions of the Ganges and Brahmaputra rivers in India, where the soil is fertile, and the climate is humid.Kerala's climate is generally warm and humid, and the state receives heavy rainfall during the southwest monsoon season, which can lead to waterlogging and damage to crops. These conditions are not ideal for jute cultivation, which requires well-drained fertile soil and a moderate climate.Therefore, jute is not cultivated on a large scale in Kerala, and there is no data available on its yield or cultivation season in the state. However, the state government has taken some initiatives to promote jute cultivation in the state and provide support to the farmers by distributing jute seeds, providing subsidies for inputs, and setting up jute mills for value addition. But these efforts are still in the nascent stages and the area under jute cultivation in the state remains limited. ",
